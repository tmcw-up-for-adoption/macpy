This project will include a solid implementation of the Max of Pairs sequence alignment algorithm in Python as the eventual goal. The code might be eventually ported to Java or C++ for speed concerns, but NumPy is an excellent array programming environment.

Currently this code includes various parts in different states:

  * Needleman Wunsch implementation
  * Max of Pairs implementation
  * Sum of Pairs implementation
  * Visualization (with PIL)
  * FASTA reading
